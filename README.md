# JS_Drum_Kit

Simple drum kit using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Click the buttons to make a sound from the drum kit or press the corresponding
keys provided on the screen.

The HTML and CSS were provided as part of the course "The Complete
2020 Web Development Bootcamp" on udemy.com.

The JavaScript was written by me while following the course.
